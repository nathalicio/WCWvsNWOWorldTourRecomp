# Development log — WCW vs. nWo World Tour: Recompiled

This is the project's historical development log (2026-05 through 2026-07), migrated
verbatim from the original working CLAUDE.md when the repo was restructured for public
release. It records, in evidence-log form, every step from raw ROM to fully playable
port: the splat disassembly, overlay decoding, libultra identification, runtime
integration, and each root-caused bug along the way. Newest findings were appended to
the relevant section at the time, so it reads as a layered status document, not a
diary. For current contributor instructions see the root CLAUDE.md and BUILDING.md.

# 2026-07-08 — v0.1.1 (launcher branding) + v0.1.2 (aspect-ratio fix)

**v0.1.1**: game logo on the launcher screen (embedded `icons/logo.png` Image element
replaces the default text title via `remove_default_title()`) + WCW app icon. Gotcha:
CMake's RC step does not track `app.ico` as a dependency — touch `app.rc` or the exe
keeps the stale icon through a "successful" rebuild.

**v0.1.2 — "can't get 4:3" root-caused (aspect was wrong in BOTH modes in matches).**
Menus (320x240 fb) were always fine; matches render an anamorphic **480x240 hi-res fb**
that hardware squeezes into the 4:3 scanout, but three places in RT64 derived aspect
from fb *pixel* dimensions (2:1):

- `rt64_workload_queue.cpp`: `aspectRatioSource = viFbSize.x/y` → in matches
  Expand's `target = max(window, source)` collapsed to `source` (scale 1, **no
  widening — Expand silently no-oped in matches**) and Original's present came out
  2:1-stretched.
- `rt64_vi_renderer.cpp` `getViewportAndScissor`: `removeBlackBorders` (RT64 default
  **true**, never overridden by the frontend) sets the virtual SD TV to `vi.fbSize()`
  → a 2:1 "TV", so `fromHDtoWindow`'s pillarbox/letterbox math (which is correct!)
  letterboxed a stretched image instead of pillarboxing a 4:3 one. Note WCW's
  `viewRectangle()` is always `{0,0,1,1}`, so rBB trimmed nothing here — it *only*
  corrupted the aspect.
- `rt64_framebuffer_renderer.cpp`: the full-screen-scissor similarity test compared
  scissor (fb-pixel units) against `aspectRatioSource`.

**Fix (`[wcw fix]` rt64 `8d70049`)**: source aspect = displayed aspect = 4:3 always
(the VI scans any fb into a 4:3 frame); similarity test now uses the fb's own
`fbWidth/fbHeight`; rBB present path keeps a 4:3 TV (`fb rows × 4/3`). Result:
Original = true pillarboxed 4:3 in matches (user-verified in-game), Expand = real
wide-FOV widening in matches (the widescreen patch's projection finally matches the
presented aspect — pre-fix Expand matches were shown at 2:1 vs the 16:9 projection,
a ~12% horizontal stretch nobody had measured). Rolled to Revenge (submodule ff,
boot-verified; its attract also runs a 480-wide fb) and Wm2k (snapshot lib patched
in place, boot-verified). Beware: `git apply` run inside a gitignored subtree of a
parent repo exits 0 without applying — verify content, not exit codes.

# 2026-07-07 — v0.1.0 public beta released

**Shipped**: https://github.com/jessetbh/WCWvsNWOWorldTourRecomp/releases/tag/v0.1.0
(repo + WCWSyms flipped public; CI-built zip + SHA256SUMS; fork-PR `external`
environment gate armed). Release-day root-causes, in the usual evidence-log form:

- **Fresh installs couldn't save (beta-QA find, would have hit every player).**
  librecomp's save buffer starts all-zero when no save file exists; libultra's pak
  filesystem reads a zeroed page-allocation table as "formatted, 0 pages free, no
  notes" (free pages are marked `0x0003`), so the game booted into "Select note to
  be erased / 0 Pages free" and could never create its note. Dev machines never saw
  it — their save predated the bug window. Fix (`[wcw fix]` in NMR si.cpp): on first
  data-region pak access, if the 32 KB image was never written, lay down an empty
  formatted mempak filesystem (checksummed ID block + backups, free-page table +
  backup), byte-for-byte per mupen64plus `format_mempak`. Verified on the release
  package: authentic "Make new note for Controller Pak?" prompt → note created
  (inode chain + note-table entry inspected in the save file) → persists → relaunch
  finds it. Existing saves untouched (any nonzero byte skips formatting).
- **The zip needed the VC++ redist (dumpbin find).** The exe and the prebuilt
  dxcompiler/dxil import MSVCP140/VCRUNTIME140/VCRUNTIME140_1/MSVCP140_ATOMIC_WAIT —
  not in stock Windows. CI now packages them app-local next to the exe (app dir
  precedes System32 in DLL search; not KnownDLLs; MS-licensed for this). Static CRT
  would NOT have sufficed (the prebuilt dxc DLLs still import them).
- **CI runner clang (22) vs local (19): `_m_prefetch`.** Both vendored SDL2 copies
  (rt64's 2.26.3 and FetchContent 2.30.3) define `_m_prefetch` in SDL_endian.h
  behind `#ifndef __PRFCHWINTRIN_H`; clang 20+ makes it a target builtin and errors
  on the redefinition. `-fno-builtin-_m_prefetch` does NOT apply to target builtins
  (verified: flag on the command line, error persists). Fix: global `/FIintrin.h`
  (clang's own prfchwintrin.h sets the guard first, SDL's hack is skipped).
- **Soak (published zip, attract loop, 10h18m)**: memory flat 314–317 MB, vis/s
  27–32 throughout, zero crashes in 32,258 health samples. Documented lead, no user
  impact: certain attract phases cause transient requeue churn (bursts to ~100k rq/s
  on mqs `0x80047C40`/`0x80047CCC`/`0x80045138`, always `msg=0x0`, ext peaks ≤65,
  self-draining in seconds; the undeliverable-message expiry sheds strays). Same
  family as the idle-thread busy-poll patched in wcw.toml, but self-recovering —
  first place to look if attract-mode bugs are ever reported.
- Also: commit-message history rewrite (all six repos, submodule gitlinks remapped
  across history), `WCWRecompiled.map` emission moved from an uncached local
  configure flag into CMakeLists, README screenshots + FAQ audit (saves live in
  `saves\`), release pipeline (tag → zip + SHA256SUMS → draft) proven end to end.

# CLAUDE.md â€” WCW vs. nWo World Tour: Recompiled

This file is the source of truth for this project. Read it before doing work here.

## What this project is

A native PC port of the Nintendo 64 game **WCW vs. nWo World Tour (USA)**, produced
by *statically recompiling* the original MIPS machine code into C using the
[N64Recomp](https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp) framework, then compiling that C
for modern platforms and running it against a modern runtime (N64ModernRuntime) with
[RT64](https://github.com/rt64/rt64) as the renderer.

This is **not** an emulator and **not** a decompilation. Static recompilation translates
the game's binary one MIPS instruction at a time into equivalent C. No game assets are
distributed; the user supplies their own ROM.

The reference project for everything here is **Bomberman Hero: Recompiled** in
the sibling `BMHeroRecomp/` checkout â€” when in doubt, mirror how it does something.

## Status at a glance (Phase 3 in progress)

Done and verified:
- **Phase 0** scaffolding/config. **Phase 1** splat disassembly + overlay system fully
  decoded (two fixed-address overlays at vram `0x80090000`). **Phase 2** N64Recomp built
  (MinGW GCC), symbols generated (symbol-TOML mode, 1763 funcs), **clean recompile â†’ 16 MB
  of C**.
- **Execution proven** by a standalone harness (`run/`): boot + game-thread code run
  faithfully; game thread busy-waits because the real runtime (threads/VI/timers) isn't
  wired yet.
- **Phase 3 foundation**: runtime libs cloned (`lib/`), **VS Build Tools/clang-cl
  installed**, and the **full recompiled output compiles with clang-cl against the real
  N64ModernRuntime headers**. libultra ~60 funcs identified (`disasm/libultra.md`).

### Immediate next steps (GAME FULLY PLAYABLE â€” next: Phase 4)
**Status (2026-07-05): the port is FULLY PLAYABLE end to end, user-verified** â€” boots,
renders, full matches with sound, keyboard + gamepad input, clean menus, and **working
saves** (Controller Pak emulation). The 2026-07-04 baseline (complete attract/demo cycle,
audio via the RSPRecomp'd stock aspMain â€” see `rsp/README.md`) was extended on 2026-07-05
with three fixes, each detailed in the âœ… bullets below: **input** (raw-SI path never
triggered recompinput's poll + single-player mode never enabled), **menu flicker/missing
assets** (RT64 frame interpolation assumes 1 workload = 1 frame, WCW uses several â†’
Framerate now defaults to Original), and **saves** (WCW saves ONLY to Controller Pak;
si.cpp now emulates a 32 KB pak in port 1 backed by librecomp's save file). Work is now
committed (was: one giant uncommitted tree) and all lib/ fixes are checked in as
`lib-patches/*.patch` (apply.ps1 / export.ps1 â€” run export after ANY lib/ edit).
**Phase-4 foundation is DONE (2026-07-05, runtime-verified)**: `syms/data_dump.toml`
generated (3,952 data symbols; `gen_symbols.py --data`) and the **patches build works
end to end** â€” `patches/*.c` â†’ MIPS (zig cc) â†’ `patches.elf` (ld.lld) â†’ `N64Recomp
patches.toml` â†’ PatchesLib in the exe; a RECOMP_PATCH'd sqrtf printed its one-shot
marker in-game. See the âœ… "PATCHES BUILD" bullet below for the sharp edges (zig, link
order, two-build quirk). **WIDESCREEN SHIPPED (2026-07-05, verified in-game)** â€” the
first real Phase-4 patch; see the âœ… "WIDESCREEN" bullet below for how it works and the
verification evidence. **OVERSCAN-EDGE CROP DONE (2026-07-05)** â€” see the âœ…
"OVERSCAN" bullet (RT64's VI origin-estimate re-exposes the fb row the game hides;
fixed with a per-edge CRT-style crop in rt64_vi.cpp, env `WCW_CROP`). **INPUT OPTIONS
DONE (2026-07-05, verified in-game)** â€” see the âœ… "INPUT OPTIONS" bullet: the recompui
config menu (General/Graphics/Controls/Sound) opens in-game via Esc / gamepad Back and
the full rebinding flow works and persists. **RUMBLE WORKS (2026-07-05, user-verified)** â€”
see the âœ… "RUMBLE" bullet: hybrid Controller/Rumble Pak identity in si.cpp, motor
commands â†’ SDL rumble, slider restored. **MULTIPLAYER WORKS (2026-07-05, user-verified)**
â€” see the âœ… "MULTIPLAYER" bullet: plug-and-play padâ†’player auto-assignment (recompinput
fork), 4 ports live, per-channel separation verified. Next up: public beta prep
(`docs/beta-release-plan.md`) and more Phase-4 enhancements (real
high-FPS interpolation needs RT64 multi-workload frame detection + matrix-group patches).
Dropped permanently
(decision 2026-07-05): upstreaming the general runtime bugs â€” the drafts in `upstream/`
stay as documentation only and will not be filed. Iterate via `tools/cycle.ps1`; `WCW_SAMPLE=<seconds>` dumps all
thread stacks at t+N; `WCW_RDC_T=<seconds>` sets the RenderDoc capture trigger time;
`WCW_PRESENT_LUM=1` + `WCW_BMP_START`/`WCW_BMP_COUNT` dump presented frames.

What got named this session (all in `tools/gen_symbols.py` RENAME, evidence inline + in
`disasm/libultra.md`): VI â€” `osViSetMode`(80012500), `osViBlack`(80012570), `osViSetEvent`
(80012650, the retrace-heartbeat fix), `osViGetCurrentFramebuffer`(800127E0),
`osViGetNextFramebuffer`(80012820), `osViSwapBuffer`(80012860), `osViSetSpecialFeatures`
(80012FB0); AI â€” `osAiGetLength`(80016BF0), `osAiSetNextBuffer`(80016B40). Plus raw-SI
(`__osSiRawStartDma`/`__osSiDeviceBusy`) backed by custom PIF emulation in `lib/.../si.cpp`,
the RSP/DP task funcs (`osSpTaskLoad`/`StartGo`/`osDpSetNextBuffer`), and a no-op audio ucode
in `src/main/main.cpp` (audio ucode located: `0x80029C50`/data `0x80037530`/`0x1000` â€” see
`rsp/README.md`).

The path-to-a-picture is DONE (2026-07-03) and the game is fully playable with saves
(2026-07-05); what follows is the historical integration guide + evidence log.
1. **libultra integration = a NAMING problem** (validated â€” see `disasm/libultra.md`).
   N64Recomp auto-ignores any function NAMED with a known libultra/libc/ido-math name
   (built-in sets in `N64Recomp/src/symbol_lists.cpp`); the runtime then provides it. So:
   add `func_XXXX â†’ <libultra name>` entries to the `RENAME` map in `tools/gen_symbols.py`,
   regen `syms/dump.toml`, recompile. Do **not** add them to `wcw.toml` `ignored` (errors).
   As each is named, drop it from the placeholder `stubs` list.
   **CORRECTION to earlier scoping:** the claim that VI-display/controller/PI/AI "stay
   recompiled and work via librecomp's hardware handling" is **WRONG** â€” `recomp.h`'s `MEM_*`
   does not trap MMIO, so any recompiled libultra that touches a hardware register (SI/PI/VI/
   AI/SP/DP/SI) crashes. These device drivers **must** be named too (the runtime implements
   them). **22 named so far** (core OS + the boot-path PI/VI/cart/thread/msg funcs that got the
   game booting). **Next to name:** the VI display setters (osViSetEvent/SwapBuffer/SetMode/
   Black @ `func_8001E280/E30C/E484/E4F8`), osSpTaskLoad/osSpTaskStartGo (â†’ gfx tasks â†’ RT64),
   osContInit/osContStartReadData (input), and the AI funcs (audio). This is what gets a frame.
3. **`src/main` wiring** â†’ `recomp::start` with gfx/input/audio/RSP/thread/error callbacks
   (adapt BMHero `src/main/main.cpp`); `GameEntry` { entrypoint `0x80000400`,
   `recomp_entrypoint`, ROM hash }.
4. **RSP microcode** recompile with `RSPRecomp` (ucode embedded in main data â†’ IMEM
   `0x84001000`) for the `get_rsp_microcode` callback.
5. **Full CMake build** (clang-cl/ninja) of recompiled libs + ultramodern + librecomp +
   RecompFrontend + RT64; then **boot and debug**.

Two toolchains: `tools/env.ps1` (MinGW GCC, builds N64Recomp) and `tools/env-msvc.ps1`
(clang-cl/MSVC, builds the port). Reproduce the recompile with `tools/recompile.ps1`; the
diagnostic harness with `run/build.ps1`.

## Local machine layout

| Thing | Path |
|-------|------|
| This project | `<workspace>\WcwNwoWorldTour` |
| N64Recomp framework (source, unbuilt) | `<workspace>\N64Recomp` |
| Reference port (Bomberman Hero) | `<workspace>\BMHeroRecomp` |
| ROMs | `<workspace>\roms` |
| WCW ROM | `<workspace>\roms\WCW vs. nWo - World Tour (USA)\WCW vs. nWo - World Tour (USA).z64` |

The environment is Windows 11 + PowerShell. The toolchain (clang, ld.lld, make) targets
the same setup BMHero documents in its `BUILDING.md`.

## Target ROM facts

Verified from the ROM file on this machine:

- **Format**: native big-endian `.z64` (header magic `80 37 12 40`)
- **SHA1**: `5AD2D8359058C8BB71F08E3D3433B7A50D3BB645`
- **MD5**: `203C3BBFDD10C5A0B7C5D0CDB085D853`
- **Size**: 12,582,912 bytes (12 MiB)
- **Entrypoint**: `0x80000400`
- **Internal name**: `WCWvs.NWO:World Tour`
- **Game code**: `NWNE` (N = cart, WN = WCW vs nWo World Tour, E = USA/NTSC)

The recompiler wants a **decompressed** ROM in some games (BMHero ships a
`rom_decompression.cpp` step). Whether WCW needs decompression is **unknown until the
ROM layout is analyzed** â€” see the roadmap. Players always supply a standard ROM; any
decompression happens internally at load time.

## How N64Recomp works (the essentials)

1. The recompiler reads a **config TOML** (first CLI arg) describing input/output paths
   plus per-function tweaks (stub/ignore/rename, single-instruction patches).
2. It needs **symbol metadata** for the target binary, supplied one of two ways:
   - **ELF mode** (`elf_path`): an ELF with symbols, produced by a disassembly/decomp.
     This is the richest mode â€” it also enables `func_reference_syms_file` /
     `data_reference_syms_files` for resolving relocations, and is what the *patches*
     build uses.
   - **Symbol-TOML mode** (`symbols_file_path` + `rom_file_path`): a hand-or-tool authored
     TOML that lists sections, functions, relocs, and data symbols. This is what
     BMHero's main recomp uses (`BMHeroSyms/dump.toml`).
3. It emits one C file per function into `output_func_path` (here `RecompiledFuncs/`),
   plus `recomp_overlays.inl`, `funcs.h`, and a section table the runtime consumes.
4. Branch delay slots are duplicated; `jal` â†’ C call; `jalr` â†’ `LOOKUP_FUNC(...)` for
   the runtime to resolve; jump tables â†’ `switch`. Relocatable overlays get
   `RELOC_HI16`/`RELOC_LO16` macros the runtime fixes up at load.
5. **RSP microcode** (audio + any graphics ucode) is recompiled separately with
   `RSPRecomp` against its own TOML (BMHero: `aspMain.toml` â†’ `rsp/n_aspMain.cpp`).

### The symbol TOML format

`dump.toml` (functions) and `data_dump.toml` (data) use this shape â€” this is exactly what
N64Recomp itself emits when run in ELF mode (`src/main.cpp::dump_context`), so the cleanest
way to produce them is: build a disassembly ELF, run the recompiler once in ELF mode, and
let it dump these files.

```toml
[[section]]
name = "..."
rom  = 0x00001000      # omitted for bss/absolute sections
vram = 0x80000400
size = 0x1234

relocs = [
    { type = "R_MIPS_HI16", vram = 0x80000420, target_vram = 0x80055000 },
    { type = "R_MIPS_LO16", vram = 0x80000424, target_vram = 0x80055000 },
]

functions = [
    { name = "func_80000400", vram = 0x80000400, size = 0x80 },
]
```

Data symbols file:
```toml
[[section]]
name = "..."
vram = 0x80055000
size = 0x2000
symbols = [
    { name = "D_80055000", vram = 0x80055000 },
]
```

## Current project state

**Phase 2 reached: the whole game recompiles to C.** Phases 1â€“2 are essentially done.

- âœ… **N64Recomp / RSPRecomp built** (GCC 16.1.0 / MinGW). Binaries copied to repo root
  (gitignored, with their MinGW runtime DLLs). See `tools/env.ps1` for the toolchain.
- âœ… **Symbols generated** from the splat disassembly via `tools/gen_symbols.py` â†’
  `syms/dump.toml` (1763 functions, symbol-TOML mode â€” no ELF needed since there's no
  MIPS assembler on this machine).
- âœ… **Clean full recompile**: `N64Recomp wcw.toml` exits 0, emitting **16 MB of C across
  36 `funcs_*.c` files** (all 1763 functions) + `funcs.h` + `recomp_overlays.inl` in
  `RecompiledFuncs/`. Reproduce with `. .\tools\env.ps1; .\tools\recompile.ps1`.
- âœ… **Overlays handled**: ambiguous `jal 0x80090000` correctly falls back to runtime
  function lookup (the overlay swap mechanism).

- âœ… **Stage-A build LINKS AND RUNS** (`cmake/coretest/`): the full recompiled game
  (16 MB / 1763 funcs) compiles with clang-cl and **links against the runtime core**
  (ultramodern + librecomp) into an executable that runs and registers the overlays
  (`build-coretest/wcw_coretest.exe` â†’ "linked + registered overlays OK"). This validates
  the libultra integration end-to-end â€” every `_recomp` shim + recomp runtime API resolves.
  (Stage A caught one bad rename: `__osDispatchThread` is not a librecomp shim and is still
  called by unnamed libultra, so it must stay stubbed, not named.)

Still NOT done (later phases):
- âœ… ~~`syms/data_dump.toml`~~ â€” GENERATED (2026-07-05): `tools/gen_symbols.py --data`
  parses the splat data/bss dlabels â†’ 3,952 symbols / 6 sections. See `syms/README.md`.
- âœ… **RT64 builds** with clang-cl (`build-rt64/rt64.lib`, 22 MB; configure standalone with
  `-DRT64_STATIC=TRUE`). Full DXC shader compilation (DXIL + SPIR-V) succeeded; deps
  (plume, re-spirv, zstd, nfd, SDL2) all built. The renderer long-pole is done.
- ðŸ”¶ **RSP microcode**: the **graphics** ucode (`D_8002AA70`/`D_8002BEA0`, built in
  `func_80002EAC`) is handled by **RT64** â€” not recompiled (confirmed: it reads RDP
  `DPC_CURRENT`). The **audio** ucode still needs `RSPRecomp`, but is best identified **at
  runtime** by logging the `OSTask` in `get_rsp_microcode` (static hunt didn't pin it down).
  See `rsp/README.md`. A first boot can return `nullptr` for audio (video works, no sound).
- âœ… **STAGE-B BUILDS AND BOOTS.** `build-msvc/WCWRecompiled.exe` (11.9 MB) links the whole
  stack (RecompiledFuncs + ultramodern + librecomp + recompui + recompinput + rt64 + SDL2).
  Build: `. .\tools\env-msvc.ps1; cmake -S . -B build-msvc -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-cl
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release; cmake --build build-msvc --target WCWRecompiled`.
  Build: `. .\tools\env-msvc.ps1; cmake -S . -B build-msvc -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-cl
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release; cmake --build build-msvc --target WCWRecompiled`.
  Getting here required: aligning lib/ submodules to BMHero's pinned commits, SDL2 FetchContent,
  DXC parent-scope vars, `patches/ui_funcs.h` + `recompui_event_structs.h`, and runtime
  contract fixes (RspUcodeFunc, register_config_path, start_game(id,mode), global
  `window`/`supported_games`, GameEntry.display_name, select_rom's game-id input).
- âœ… **RT64 + RENDER CONTEXT NOW INITIALIZE (D3D12, local desktop).** The earlier
  "`0xC0000409` abort in graphics-API interface creation / headless-session" conclusion was
  **WRONG**. The abort was `std::terminate`/`abort` (ucrtbase!abort) from an **uncaught C++
  exception on the gfx thread**, whose marker interleaved with the D3D12 markers and made it
  *look* like `D3D12CreateDevice` crashed. With a `std::set_terminate` handler + backtrace
  (added in `src/main/main.cpp`), `D3D12CreateDevice(Device8)` on the RTX 4070 SUPER
  **succeeds**; RT64 reports the device and `create_render_context` returns OK. The real boot
  blockers were **missing recompui init that BMHero's launcher does and our minimal main.cpp
  skipped** â€” fixed in `src/main/main.cpp` (in order encountered):
  1. **config tabs**: `recompui::config::create_general_tab/graphics/controls/sound + finalize()`
     â€” the input/render paths read these; absent â†’ "General config has not been created yet".
  2. **fonts**: `register_primary_font("InterVariable.ttf",...) + register_extra_font(...)`,
     and an **`assets/` folder** in the working dir (copied from BMHero: fonts, `recomp.rcss`,
     `icons/`, `promptfont/`, `NotoEmoji`). `get_asset_path` = `./assets/...` on Windows.
  3. **program identity**: `recompui::programconfig::set_program_name/ set_program_id`.
  4. **`supported_games[0]`**: the entry must be pushed into the global `supported_games`
     vector (not just `register_game`'d) â€” recompui's `default_launcher_init_callback`
     dereferences `supported_games[0]`; empty â†’ access violation.
- âœ… **THE PORT NOW BOOTS AND RUNS WITH NO CRASH** (2026-06-09). Confirmed by naming the
  boot-path libultra (see `disasm/libultra.md` for the full list + evidence) so ultramodern
  provides them instead of the game's recompiled MMIO-touching copies. The key fixes, in order:
  1. **`entrypoint_address` sign-extension bug** in `src/main/main.cpp`: it's a `gpr` (int64);
     the literal `0x80000400` is `unsigned int` â†’ zero-extends to `0x0000000080000400`, and
     librecomp's `MEM_*` macro (`rdram + (addr - 0xFFFFFFFF80000000)`) then lands the initial
     boot DMA at `rdram + 0x100000400` (+4 GB, uncommitted) â†’ AV. Fixed with
     `(gpr)(int32_t)0x80000400`. (Latent: earlier runs survived by luck.)
  2. **8 new libultra names** (this validated the MMIO theory â€” each crash was raw register
     I/O or an un-populated `__osRunningThread`/`__osThreadTail`): `osInitialize` (func_800112D0,
     was mis-mapped to the exception handler func_8001CD70 â€” now stubbed), `osGetThreadPri`,
     `osSetThreadPri`, `osCreateMesgQueue`, `osSetEventMesg`, `osCreatePiManager`,
     `osCartRomInit`, `osCreateViManager`.
  - Iterate with **`tools/cycle.ps1`** (regen symbols â†’ N64Recomp â†’ clang-cl build â†’ run â†’
    symbolize crash frames against `build-msvc/WCWRecompiled.map`). The recompile+build is
    only a few seconds (incremental).
- âœ… **GAME LOGIC NOW RUNS** (2026-06-09, second pass). +3 more names got the game from "boots"
  to "runs game code": `osEPiStartDma` (**func_80011E20** â€” the overlay loader spun retrying it
  because the game's PI device-manager thread no longer drains the cmd queue once
  osCreatePiManager is ultramodern's; routing to `osEPiStartDma_recomp` does the DMA directly â†’
  **overlays load**), `osAiSetFrequency` (**func_80013DA0**), `osContInit` (**func_800172E0**).
  Thread model: `func_800004AC` = idle thread (sets up managers, spawns the worker + game-logic
  threads, lowers its priority, spins a PRNG); `func_80000CBC` = graphics scheduler (registers
  `0x8003CAB8` via osSetEventMesg for OS_EVENT_SP/DP/PRENMI, blocks in osRecvMesg for RSP/RDP
  completion); the driver is the **game-logic/overlay thread** (entry `ovl_swap_loop`). It now
  loads overlays and runs game code through audio init.
- âœ… **Controller reads (raw SI) â€” SOLVED by PIF emulation.** WCW rolls its own synchronous
  raw-SI controller layer (`func_80023C60` + 13 callers) on the libultra primitives
  `__osSiRawStartDma`=func_80023970 / `__osSiDeviceBusy`=func_800251E0 (raw `SI_STATUS @
  0xA4800018`, untrapped by `MEM_*`). Fixed by **naming both primitives** and giving
  `lib/N64ModernRuntime/librecomp/src/si.cpp` a custom 64-byte PIF/joybus emulation: the
  `*_recomp` shims latch the game's PIF command block, run joybus against host input
  (`osContGetReadData`), copy results back, and `send_si_message`. Carried the game past
  controller init.
- âœ… **KEYBOARD/PAD INPUT REACHES THE GAME (2026-07-05).** Root cause of "no input": nothing
  ever called `recompinput::poll_inputs()` â€” it latches `SDL_GetKeyboardState` + the controller
  list, and its only caller is `osContStartReadData` (via the `poll_input` callback), which WCW
  never calls (raw-SI path above). **Fix (`[wcw fix]`)**: new `ultramodern::input::poll_input()`
  (ultramodern input.hpp/cpp) invoked from `si.cpp::wcw_process_pif()` before
  `osContGetReadData`. Verified end-to-end by injecting WM_KEYDOWN into the game window: the
  throttled `[input]` log in si.cpp shows `buttons=1000` (Start) for Enter and `stick=(82,0)`
  for held D; the game polls ~60/s. Default keyboard map: SUPERSEDED 2026-07-05 by the
  WCW-specific defaults in `src/main/main.cpp` (see the âœ… "DEFAULT LAYOUT" bullet) â€”
  now WASD=d-pad (move), IJKL=stick (taunt); Enter=Start, Space=A, LShift=B, Q=Z, E/R=L/R,
  arrows=C buttons are unchanged from recompinput's generic `input_mapping.cpp` defaults.
  **Gamepad also verified working** (same day):
  needed `recompinput::players::set_single_player_mode(true)` in `src/main/main.cpp` (BMHero
  does this; we didn't) â€” in the default multiplayer mode, controller reads require a pad
  explicitly assigned via the player-assignment UI (never shown), so pads were silently
  ignored while keyboard (which skips assignment) worked. Verified: user's XInput pad
  produces A/D-pad N64 bits end to end. **User confirmed full matches playable end to end
  with menus navigable (2026-07-05).** The temporary `[inpoll]`/`[input]` diagnostics were
  removed after verification (si.cpp / input_state.cpp). NOTE: set_single_player_mode(true)
  was SUPERSEDED same day by full multiplayer â€” see the âœ… "MULTIPLAYER" bullet.
- âœ… **MULTIPLAYER WORKS (2026-07-05, user-verified): plug-and-play 4-player.** main.cpp now
  boots recompinput in multiplayer mode (`set_single_player_mode(false)` +
  `set_player_count_range(1, 4)`, BEFORE create_controls_tab â€” the tab snapshots the mode)
  with a recompinput fork addition (`[wcw fix]`, in lib-patches/RecompFrontend.patch):
  **auto-assignment** â€” `players::auto_assign_controller()` claims the first free player
  slot for each detected/hotplugged pad (pad 1â†’P1, pad 2â†’P2, ...; a vacated slot is refilled
  first, so replug returns a pad to its old player), called from the CONTROLLERDEVICEADDED
  handler; keyboard always drives P1 via the default player-0 profiles, so solo play needs
  no ceremony and the Controls-tab "Assign players" modal remains for custom setups (e.g.
  keyboard as P2). Three upstream latent bugs fixed along the way (single-player-only games
  never hit them): (1) `players_input_profile_indices` zero-initializes and profile 0 is the
  SP KEYBOARD profile â†’ unassigned players 2-4 mirrored the keyboard in MP mode (fixed:
  init to -1; get_n64_input skips negatives); (2) CONTROLLERDEVICEREMOVED left a dangling
  SDL_GameController* in the player slot (fixed: `players::handle_controller_removed()`
  nulls it; slot stays assigned/neutral); (3) assigning the keyboard to P1 via the modal
  created an EMPTY mp keyboard profile â†’ all keys dead until manually rebound (fixed: P1's
  mp keyboard profile seeds from the SP defaults; P2+ still start empty on purpose).
  `get_connected_device_info` now reports all 4 ports as Controller (pak still port 1 only)
  so every slot is joinable. Verified headlessly with `WCW_VPADS=<n>` (main.cpp attaches n
  SDL virtual gamepads pulsing distinct buttons) + `WCW_INPUT_LOG=1` (throttled per-channel
  log in si.cpp, both kept env-gated): vpad1â†’ch0 A-bit, vpad2â†’ch1 C-Down-bit, no
  cross-mirroring, keyboard-only run drives ONLY ch0; Controls tab renders the MP player
  cards + Assign players button. **User verified real multiplayer matches work great.**
  Rumble in MP: motor commands are port-1-only (the emulated pak lives there), so only P1's
  pad rumbles â€” P2-4 pads report no pak (accurate to whatever's plugged in those ports).
- âœ… **SAVES WORK (2026-07-05, user-verified): Controller Pak emulation.** WCW saves ONLY
  to the Controller Pak (no cart EEPROM/SRAM â€” unusual; most ported games have batteries),
  and the recomp stack has no pak support (`Pak` enum only has RumblePak; osPfs* is
  unimplemented). But WCW's homegrown raw-SI driver speaks joybus directly through our PIF
  emulation, so `si.cpp` emulates a standard 32 KB pak in port 1: status byte reports
  pak-present (0x01), joybus cmd `0x02`/`0x03` = 32-byte block read/write with the mempak
  data CRC (poly 0x85), bank/ID region (>= 0x8000) reads zeros / acks writes without storing
  (mupen64plus semantics â€” this is how games distinguish mempak from Rumble Pak's 0x80s).
  Backing store = librecomp's save subsystem: `GameEntry.save_type = SaveType::Sram`
  (exactly 32 KB) in `src/main/main.cpp`, new host-pointer `save_read_ptr` in librecomp
  `pi.cpp`; pak contents persist to `saves/<game id>.bin` with async atomic writes + backup.
  Boot-verified: game runs accessory-detect (write/read `0x8001`), accepts the pak, writes
  filesystem blocks. One-shot `[wcw] first Controller Pak read/write` stderr markers remain.
- âœ… **PATCHES BUILD STANDS (2026-07-05, runtime-verified) â€” Phase-4 foundation.** Full
  BMHero-style pipeline: `patches/*.c` --(MIPS cross-compile)--> `patches/patches.elf`
  --(`N64Recomp patches.toml`, ELF mode w/ `syms/dump.toml` + new `syms/data_dump.toml`)-->
  `RecompiledPatches/patches.c` + `patches.bin` --(file_to_c)--> `PatchesLib` â†’ registered by
  `src/main/register_patches.cpp` (called from main.cpp). Verified in-game: a RECOMP_PATCH'd
  `func_80013BF0` (= sqrtf, 9 call sites) printed its one-shot `[patches] ... is live` marker
  on stdout; a second patch (`func_80000644`, `return D_8003CCF4`) proves extern data
  resolution against data_dump.toml (lui/lw of the exact vram). Sharp edges discovered:
  1. **No Windows clang has a MIPS backend** â€” BOTH VS BuildTools' LLVM and the official
     llvm.org Windows binaries are trimmed to x86/ARM. The MIPS compiler is **`zig cc`**
     (`<toolchains>\zig-windows-x86_64-0.14.0`, bundles full LLVM 19; flags:
     `-target mips-freestanding-none -mcpu=mips2`, emits the same non-PIC R_MIPS_HI16/LO16/26
     relocs). **ld.lld's MIPS support is unconditional**, so the llvm.org 19.1.5 toolchain
     (`<toolchains>\clang+llvm-19.1.5-...`) links patches.elf fine.
  2. **Link order is the patch mechanism**: PatchesLib MUST precede RecompiledFuncs in
     `target_link_libraries` â€” patched funcs share their C symbol with the base recompiled
     copies and take effect by winning static-lib resolution (silently inert if reversed).
  3. **Two-build quirk** (same as BMHero's TODO): after editing patch C files, the first
     `cmake --build` regenerates RecompiledPatches but links the old table; build twice.
  4. `patches/syms.ld` must ONLY list runtime symbols that exist in the link (librecomp's
     `*_recomp` set + our `src/game/recomp_api.cpp`, currently recomp_puts/recomp_exit
     with stdout flush) â€” every entry lands in the generated `manual_patch_symbols` table
     as a link-time reference. BMHero's game-side APIs (recomp_load_overlays, recomp_xxh3,
     â€¦) were trimmed; re-add entries as we implement them.
  5. `patches/dummy_headers/` provides freestanding `stdint.h` + `ultra64.h` (libultra
     primitive types) â€” ultramodern's ultra64.h is C++-only (bare struct-tag refs) and WCW
     has no decomp headers to borrow. NOTE: unlike BMHero, NO overlay-loader patch is needed
     (librecomp auto-loads our fixed-address overlays on PI DMA â€” proven since Phase 3).
  Build: `mingw32-make` in `patches/` (defaults wired for this machine; `make clean` works
  under cmd), or just `cmake --build build-msvc` (PatchesBin target drives it; tool paths
  overridable via `-DPATCHES_C_COMPILER/-DPATCHES_LD/-DPATCHES_MAKE`).
- âœ… **WIDESCREEN SHIPPED (2026-07-05, verified in-game) â€” first real Phase-4 patch.**
  WCW composes MVPs on the CPU (G_FORCEMTX-only), so the fix is at the projection's
  source: the game has exactly ONE `guPerspectiveF` call â€” `func_80006860`, the camera
  setup (fov 33Â°, aspect 4/3 inline, near 100/far 4000, then guLookAtF with up=(0,1,0)).
  gu* cluster identified and documented in `disasm/libultra.md` ("gu* math cluster"):
  guPerspectiveF=func_8001BD90, guLookAtF=func_8001C020, guMtxF2L=func_80013210,
  sinf/cosf=func_8001C970/func_8001CB30. **âš ï¸ do NOT put gu*/sinf/cosf names in the
  gen_symbols RENAME map** â€” N64Recomp auto-ignores known libultra names and librecomp
  has no gu math shims; they must stay recompiled as func_XXXX. The patch
  (`patches/widescreen.c`) RECOMP_PATCHes func_80006860 to pass
  `recomp_get_target_aspect_ratio(4/3)` â€” new host API in `src/game/recomp_api.cpp`
  (BMHero semantics: Originalâ†’4/3, Expandâ†’window ratio, floor 4/3) + syms.ld entry
  0x8F000084. With Aspect Ratio=Expand the projection pre-squeezes X in NDC and RT64's
  Expand mode gives full-width perspective projections the wide viewport
  (useWideViewport in rt64_framebuffer_renderer.cpp) â†’ wider hFOV, correct proportions;
  vFOV unchanged; 2D texrects stay 4:3-anchored (title "Press START" verified centered/
  unstretched). Verified via present-BMP dumps at 2560x1440: attract match + title
  render correct with Expand; Original mode is bit-identical to pre-patch (aspect==4/3
  â†’ same matrix). Note: in Original mode fullscreen has ALWAYS stretched 4:3 to 16:9
  (user played that way); Expand is now the correct-proportions mode. The two pipeline-
  verification patches (func_80000644, sqrtf) were removed with this landing;
  build-msvc/graphics.json flipped to ar_option=Expand.
- âœ… **OVERSCAN-EDGE GARBAGE FIXED (2026-07-05): per-edge CRT-style crop.** Root cause
  chain (measured via `WCW_CROP=0` present dumps + the extended `[wcw][present]` VI
  log): the match runs a 480-wide fb with textbook NTSC VI timing (h=108..748,
  v=37..511, xscale 0x300, yscale 0x400) and **origin parked at fb + exactly 1 row** â€”
  the game deliberately skips its undrawn fb row 0. RT64's `VI::fbAddress()` "origin is
  off by one or two rows" estimate subtracts that row back off; the subtraction is
  REQUIRED (without it the fb lookup misses and every present drops to the native-res
  scratch path â€” verified: `fbFound=0`, `scratch=60/s`, chunky image), but it re-exposes
  fb row 0, and RT64 scans out all ~240 fb rows while hardware showed only 1..237.
  **Fix**: `VI::cropRectangle()` in `lib/rt64/src/hle/rt64_vi.cpp` (`[wcw fix]`) crops
  per-edge in SD-pixel units â€” default L4,T4,R4,B8; env `WCW_CROP=<n>` or
  `WCW_CROP=L,T,R,B` overrides â€” which the VI renderer turns into the present scissor.
  Bottom is 8 because RT64 shows fb rows ~238-239 that hardware never did. (The bright
  bottom-left "speckle" turned out to be the legit white ring skirt â€” smooth,
  low-noise â€” don't crop 16px chasing it.) The earlier flat-2px version of this fix
  existed ONLY in the gitignored lib/ tree â€” never exported to `lib-patches/`; a
  reclone would have silently lost it. Now exported (run export.ps1 after EVERY lib/
  edit; note it dies on git's CRLF stderr warnings â€” $ErrorActionPreference=Stop â€” run
  the git-diff redirections via bash if so).
- âœ… **INPUT OPTIONS DONE (2026-07-05, verified in-game end to end).** No new feature code
  was needed â€” the whole recompui config stack was already wired and just unverified:
  draw_hook (RecompFrontend `ui_state.cpp`) opens `recompui::config::open()` on Esc or the
  gamepad TOGGLE_MENU button (default: Back/Select, rebindable) once `is_game_started()`;
  main.cpp already creates all four tabs; and while a menu context captures input,
  `recompinput::game_input_disabled()` makes `get_n64_input` return neutral â€” which covers
  WCW's raw-SI path too, since `si.cpp::wcw_process_pif` reads via `osContGetReadData`.
  Verified headlessly (window-message injection + swapchain-readback BMPs, which capture
  the UI because the readback in rt64_present_queue.cpp happens AFTER the drawHook):
  Esc opens the menu over the running game; clicking the Controls tab shows the full N64
  rebinding UI (2 slots per input, keyboard/controller device switcher, reset-to-defaults);
  a full UI rebind (A: Spaceâ†’P) wrote controls.json (input_id 44â†’19, restored afterward);
  Esc again closes back to a clean game view. Two small changes landed: one-shot
  `[wcw][ui] config menu opened` marker in ui_state.cpp (exported to lib-patches), and
  `GeneralTabOptions.has_rumble_strength = false` in main.cpp (SUPERSEDED same day: rumble
  now works via the hybrid pak â€” see the âœ… "RUMBLE" bullet; slider is back). Test scripts pattern:
  poll `wcw_present_lum.csv` for present N, PostMessage WM_KEYDOWN/WM_MOUSE* to the SDL_app
  window (FindWindowW from PS marshals $null class as "" â€” enumerate windows by pid
  instead), BMP-dump a window aimed past the interaction. Tab-switch fake keys (F16/F17)
  did NOT work via injected WM_KEYDOWN; mouse clicks on the tab headers do.
- âœ… **DEFAULT LAYOUT: WCW-specific bindings (2026-07-05, verified in-game).** The generic
  recomp defaults fit WCW badly â€” this game MOVES ON THE D-PAD and taunts with the analog
  stick (manual: A=grapple, B=attack, L=duck/dodge, R=block, C-Down=run, C-Up=climb/flip,
  C-Left/Right=focus, Z=unused in-ring), so the old layout had "move" off the left stick,
  duck on LB while block sat on RT, and LT wasted on Z. New defaults, set via
  `recompinput::set_default_mapping_for_controller/keyboard` in `src/main/main.cpp`
  (MUST run before the config tabs load â€” the API throws after first use): move = left
  stick + d-pad (both emit d-pad), taunt = right stick, duck = LEFT TRIGGER and block =
  RIGHT TRIGGER (mirrored defensive pair â€” deliberate), grapple=A/South, attack=X/West,
  run=B/East (C-Down), climb/flip=Y/North (C-Up), focus=LB/RB (C-Left/Right), Z parked on
  left-stick click. Keyboard: WASD=move (d-pad), IJKL=taunt (stick); rest unchanged.
  Verified: Controls tab shows the new bindings, and MODE SELECT responds to d-pad
  (selection moved WCW-vs-NWO â†’ League on d-pad-down) so left-stick menu nav works.
  GOTCHAS: (1) saved profiles override defaults â€” and the config loader
  (`read_json_with_backups`) falls back to `controls.json.bak`, so BOTH controls.json and
  the .bak must be deleted for new defaults to appear (this bit us: deleting only the
  .json silently reloaded the old layout from the backup). (2) Rumble correction to the
  2026-07-05 slider decision: the game DOES support the Rumble Pak on hardware ("Rumble
  Pak supported â€” Insert a Rumble Pak now" prompt after Start at the title, waits for a
  button) â€” RESOLVED same day by the hybrid pak (see the âœ… "RUMBLE" bullet).
- âœ… **RUMBLE WORKS (2026-07-05, user-verified): hybrid Controller/Rumble Pak.** A real N64
  has one pak slot per controller â€” WCW saves to the Controller Pak but rumbles with the
  Rumble Pak, physically swapped on hardware. The port's virtual pak in librecomp
  `si.cpp` (`[wcw fix]`) is now BOTH via an identity state machine: default identity is
  mempak (bank/ID-region reads = zeros â†’ saves keep working exactly as before); a uniform
  0x80 block written to the bank region (the Rumble Pak probe/init, sent when the player
  answers the title-screen "Insert a Rumble Pak now" prompt) flips identity to rumble
  (bank reads = 0x80s in the 0x8000..0x8FFF window, like hardware) until any other bank
  value is written (0xFE probe-reset / 0x00 bank select â†’ back to mempak, motor forced
  off). Pak writes to the 0xC000 region are motor commands (data 0x01=on/0x00=off) â†’
  new public `ultramodern::input::set_rumble()` (input.hpp/cpp `[wcw fix]`, mirrors the
  poll_input exposure â€” WCW's raw-SI driver never calls osMotor*) â†’ recompinput's SDL
  rumble. Save-region (<0x8000) reads/writes are honored regardless of identity, so saves
  can never be lost to rumble. `src/main/main.cpp`: `vi_callback =
  recompinput::update_rumble` (was nullptr â€” update_rumble ramps/decays the actual SDL
  motor each VI; BMHero registers it the same way) and `has_rumble_strength = true`
  (update_rumble is a NO-OP when the option is absent; slider restored, no longer dead
  weight). Bounded `[wcw][pak]` stderr diagnostics remain (dedup'd bank-op log, capped 64
  lines + one-shot motor ON/OFF markers). Enable in-game: press Start at the title,
  answer the Rumble Pak prompt with a button.
- ✅ **4-MINUTE IN-MATCH SLOWDOWN + SFX LOSS SOLVED (2026-07-06): unbounded
  external-message backlog.** User report: ~4 minutes into play the game slows down
  drastically and sound EFFECTS stop (music keeps playing); persists across matches,
  cleared only by restarting the app. Root cause (found by a new 1/s `[wcw][health]`
  metric line, now env-gated `WCW_HEALTH_LOG=1`, in ultramodern `mesgqueue.cpp`): WCW
  fires PI DMAs from three DMA queues (`0x80047C40`/`0x80047CCC`/`0x80045138`) whose
  completion messages it NEVER receives — fire-and-forget, legal on hardware where the
  PI manager posts completions `OS_MESG_NOBLOCK` and a full queue silently drops them.
  librecomp instead posts them with `requeue_if_blocked=true`, so each orphan became a
  permanent resident of ultramodern's `external_messages` queue: backlog grew ~55/s
  during gameplay (measured `ext=14k` at the 4-minute mark), and since EVERY
  osSendMesg/osRecvMesg on a game thread drains-and-requeues the entire backlog
  (`dequeue_external_messages`), per-call cost is O(backlog) under `message_mutex` —
  measured 25M requeue cycles/s. That progressively starves game threads (the slowdown)
  and delays legitimate deliveries like the sound driver's sample-DMA handshakes (SFX
  silent; sequenced music survives). Matches "persists across matches / reset on
  restart": the orphaned queues are never drained by the game, and the backlog lives in
  the host process. **Fix (`[wcw fix]` 1ca2f84, N64ModernRuntime fork)**: stamp each
  external message at enqueue; retry undeliverable requeue-if-blocked messages for a 1 s
  grace window (requeue exists to paper over librecomp's instant-DMA timing — a
  completion can land while the game's queue is momentarily full, where real DMA latency
  would have let the game drain it first), then DROP, exactly as hardware would have at
  DMA time. Verified over 10+ min of continuous scripted matches (synthetic keyboard
  input): backlog bounded ≤74 (was unbounded), orphans expired at the previous growth
  rate (~10–55/s, scales with gameplay activity), steady 30 viswaps/s, zero audio
  underruns. Note for later: the user's prior session log ends with an access violation
  INSIDE `do_send` (delivering to `0x80047C40`) at app exit — a teardown race (runtime
  threads still delivering after rdram is freed) made ~million× likelier by the old
  backlog churn; if it ever recurs post-fix, that's the spot.
- âœ… **VI display + AI + RSP-task submission â€” NAMED; first frame REACHES RT64.** osViSetMode/
  Black/SetEvent/SwapBuffer/GetCurrent+NextFramebuffer/SetSpecialFeatures (0x80012xxx),
  osAiGetLength/SetNextBuffer (0x80016xxx), osSpTaskLoad/StartGo + osDpSetNextBuffer. `vi.mq`
  now registered, mode set, `osSpTaskStartGo type=1` â†’ `submit_rsp_task` â†’ RT64 renders; window
  shows. See `disasm/libultra.md`.
- âœ… **Frame-sync deadlock â€” SOLVED (idle thread monopolized the cooperative scheduler).** A few
  frames in, ALL game threads blocked in `osRecvMesg` while the VI thread kept enqueuing retrace â€”
  but ultramodern's scheduler is **non-preemptive**, and the idle thread `func_800004AC` busy-spins
  `jal func_80011BF0(PRNG); b L_80000584` making no syscall, so it never yields â†’ retrace is never
  delivered â†’ deadlock. N64Recomp only injects `pause_self()` for a self-branch (`b .`); WCW's loop
  branches to the jal. **Fix = a one-instruction `wcw.toml` patch** rewriting the branch at
  `0x8000058C` to `b .` (`0x1000FFFF`) so the recompiler emits `pause_self()` (the correct
  cooperative idle-yield). Now the frame pipeline flows continuously and the game **advances Aâ†’B
  overlays**. Full analysis in `disasm/libultra.md`.
- âœ… **64-bit math (softfloat) cluster fixed.** `func_800134AC..func_80013918` was fully stubbed
  (garbage). Split: integer group (ddiv/ddivu/dmultu) un-stubbed â†’ real code; FP<->int64 group
  NAMED to IDO `__d_to_ll`/`__f_to_ll`/`__d_to_ull`/`__f_to_ull`/`__ll_to_d`/`__ll_to_f`/
  `__ull_to_d`/`__ull_to_f` (4 missing `_recomp` shims added to librecomp `math_routines.cpp`).
- âœ… **Frozen game clock â€” FIXED.** `osGetCount` (`func_8001EB30` = `mfc0 $9`) was stubbed â†’ the
  clock never advanced (timed waits frozen). Named `func_8001EB30`â†’`osGetCount`,
  `func_80023800`â†’`osGetTime` (removed from stubs). Real fix; didn't change rendering.
- âœ… **GAME-SIDE RENDERING FULLY EXONERATED (2026-06-12).** The "overlay B emits empty display
  lists / 6 frames then stop" conclusion was an artifact of a capped diagnostic log. Hard counters
  prove the game submits **~27 graphics tasks/second continuously** and has been drawing its full
  title screen all along (~30 tris + a screenful of texrects per frame: portrait grid + banners,
  animating fade colors, real textures + palettes, triple-buffered, presented with osViSwapBuffer
  + a healthy frame handshake). Everything game/recomp-side WORKS.
- âœ… **BLACK SCREEN SOLVED (2026-07-03) â€” THE GAME RENDERS.** Title screen, intro cinematics, and
  full attract-mode 3D (ring + crowd + animated wrestler) all render correctly, verified by
  RenderDoc render-target dumps AND a live-window screenshot. Root cause (found via RenderDoc
  capture + programmatic analysis, see `disasm/libultra.md` "BLACK SCREEN â€” SOLVED"): every game
  draw's VS output position was NaN. WCW's AKI-engine ucode **never loads a projection matrix** â€”
  it submits fully composed MVPs via `G_FORCEMTX` only â€” so RT64's `viewProjMatrixStack` top stays
  at its all-zero reset value, and `RSP::setVertexCommon` computed `inverse(zero)` = NaN, poisoning
  every world transform (`world = MVP Ã— inv(VP)`) and zeroing the uploaded viewProj. **Fix** (in
  `lib/rt64/src/hle/rt64_rsp.cpp`, `[wcw fix]` tags): `isMatrixZero()` guard at the two consumers â€”
  a never-loaded zero VP is treated as identity, so `world = MVP` and `viewProj = identity`,
  preserving `viewProj Ã— world = MVP`. Affects only forceMatrix-only games. lib/ is gitignored, so
  this patch must be preserved/reapplied if lib/rt64 is ever recloned (carried locally
  for good â€” upstreaming was declined; see `upstream/README.md`).
  Env `WCW_INSPECTOR=1` auto-opens RT64's frame inspector (renders, but needs input forwarding).
- ðŸ”§ **RenderDoc workflow (validated, fully scriptable â€” how the black screen was cracked):**
  RenderDoc 1.44 at `C:\Program Files\RenderDoc`. `src/main/main.cpp` self-triggers
  `TriggerMultiFrameCapture(12)` at t+8s when `renderdoc.dll` is injected (multi-frame because the
  game submits ~27 gfx tasks/s vs ~60 presents â€” single frames can contain only the VI blit).
  Capture: `renderdoccmd.exe capture --working-dir build-msvc --capture-file <dir>\wcw
  --wait-for-exit build-msvc\WCWRecompiled.exe`, kill game after ~20s. Analyze headlessly:
  `qrenderdoc.exe --python script.py` (embedded Python; `pyrenderdoc.LoadCapture(...)` +
  `Replay().BlockInvoke(fn)`; write results to a file, kill qrenderdoc after). Can dump draw
  state, buffers (`GetBufferData`), postVS (`GetPostVSData`), and save render targets to PNG
  (`SaveTexture`) for visual verification without a human watching the screen.
- âœ… **ATTRACT-END DEADLOCK SOLVED (2026-07-04) â€” the game now runs its demo loop forever.**
  The game froze deterministically at graphics task #331 (end of the attract sequence): every
  game thread parked in `osRecvMesg`, process alive. Root cause was **ultramodern's external-
  message pump** (`wait_for_external_message` in `lib/N64ModernRuntime/ultramodern/src/
  mesgqueue.cpp`, used by `pause_self` â€” the patched idle thread is the pump): it processed
  ONE message per wake and re-enqueued failed deliveries immediately. moodycamel's
  ConcurrentQueue is not FIFO across producers (consumers prefer their own producer's
  sub-queue), so a few `requeue_if_blocked` messages aimed at full 1-deep queues (SI/PIF
  completions during the scene transition) spun in a closed dequeueâ†’failâ†’requeue loop that
  **starved every other producer's messages â€” including the VI retrace** â†’ no wakeups â†’ total
  deadlock. **Fix (`[wcw fix]`)**: drain ALL available messages per wake, requeue failures
  after the drain, 1ms backoff if nothing was deliverable. **This is an upstream
  N64ModernRuntime bug** (any game can hit it). Two hardening fixes went in alongside:
  `osViSetEvent` now writes BOTH double-buffered ViStates (hardware semantics: latest call
  wins globally), and the VI retrace pacing counter reloads with `<= 0` + clamp-to-1 so one
  bad `retrace_count` read can't kill retrace forever (both in `ultramodern/src/events.cpp`).
- âœ… **F3DLX ucode-switch crashes fixed by 2 more libultra names (2026-07-04).** After the
  deadlock fix the game advanced to overlay B's second gfx ucode ("F3DLX 1.23.Rej (Variant)",
  text=0x2BEA0) and crashed twice in the scheduler's yield path â€” raw SP_STATUS MMIO in
  unnamed recompiled libultra. Named (in `tools/gen_symbols.py`): `func_80012C80` â†’
  `osSpTaskYield` (`__osSpSetStatus(SP_SET_SIG0)`), `func_80012760` â†’ `osSpTaskYielded`
  (reads `__osSpGetStatus`=func_8001EB40, tests YIELD/YIELDED bits). sp.cpp provides both shims.
- âœ… **Audio: WORKING (2026-07-04).** The audio ucode (ROM `0x2A850`, text size `0xE20` â€” the
  OSTask's `0x1000` is the rounded DMA size) is RSPRecomp'd via `rsp/wcw_audio.toml` â†’
  `rsp/wcw_audio.cpp` (`wcw_audio_ucode`), returned by `get_rsp_microcode` for M_AUDTASK
  (no-op kept as fallback for unknown task types â€” never return `nullptr`, that quick-exits).
  It's stock aspMain, byte-identical to BMHero's, so BMHero's `extra_indirect_branch_targets`
  applied verbatim. CMake: `rsp/wcw_audio.cpp` added to SOURCES + `-march=nehalem` (SSE4.1
  for librecomp's VU intrinsics). Verified via the throttled `[audio]` peak log in
  `queue_samples`. See `rsp/README.md`.
- âœ… **MENU FLICKER + "MISSING ASSETS" ROOT-CAUSED (2026-07-05): RT64 frame interpolation.**
  With Framerate=Display (the old default), swapchain readback showed bursts of pure-black
  presents (same VI origin re-presented 2-6x black after one good frame) in menus/title;
  `WCW_NO_INTERP=1` â†’ **zero** black presents. Cause: RT64's interpolated-frame generation
  assumes **1 workload = 1 game frame** (`rt64_workload_queue.cpp` line ~991 TODO), but WCW
  builds one frame from MULTIPLE RSP tasks â€” so interpolation re-renders only a slice of a
  frame (often just the pre-clear) â†’ black/partially-drawn presents. Matches usually keep the
  whole 3D scene in one workload, which is why they looked fine. **Fix**: default Framerate
  = `RefreshRate::Original` (`[wcw fix]` in recompui `ui_config_tab_graphics.cpp`; also flipped
  the user's saved `build-msvc/graphics.json` since saved config overrides the default).
  Verified: 0 black presents, title screen pixel-perfect via BMP dump. Capture tooling
  upgraded: `WCW_BMP_START`/`WCW_BMP_COUNT`/`WCW_LUM_END`
  env vars aim the present-BMP dump window at any moment (defaults 600/13/1500). Known minor
  artifact: overscan-edge garbage rows (thin line top, speckle bottom-left) â€” CRT-hidden on
  hardware; polish later.
- âŒâž¡ï¸ðŸ”’ **DISPLAY FRAMERATE / FRAME INTERPOLATION: ATTEMPTED, REVERTED, OPTION LOCKED
  (2026-07-05).** A full fix for the Framerate=Display black-frame flicker was built and
  readback-verified (multi-workload frame grouping in rt64_workload_queue + present-fb-address
  interpolation-target selection + override-target priming â€” the complete implementation and
  analysis live in **git history at commit `53000eb`**, lib-patches/rt64.patch of that commit),
  but was **reverted the same day**: with flicker gone, the interpolated frames instead WARP
  GEOMETRY ("polygons bounce all over" â€” user-reported unplayable in real gameplay). Root
  cause of the warping is fundamental, not a bug: WCW is **G_FORCEMTX-only**, so RT64's
  worldTransforms are full pre-multiplied MVPs and its heuristic transform matching
  (position/orientation/screen-space metrics meant for model matrices) mispairs them â€”
  interpolation then lerps between unrelated matrices. **The proper fix is Phase-4 matrix-group
  patches** (game-side stable matrix IDs via G_EX, requires locating WCW's CPU matrix
  composition sites) â€” anyone reattempting should START from `53000eb`, whose three findings
  remain valid and readback-verified:
  1. WCW builds one visual frame from 1-7 RSP workloads (menus most, matches least); grouping
     by shared `presentId` + a present-submission signal works and needs GameFrame matching
     hardened for variable group sizes (empty-map OOB crashes in matchScene otherwise).
  2. The interpolation target MUST be the present's VI fb: WCW pre-clears the NEXT buffer as
     each frame's LAST fbPair, so RT64's backward candidate scan reliably picks the wrong
     buffer (â†’ black re-renders), and `interpolationEnabled` ping-pongs exactly wrong for
     triple-buffered pre-clear games.
  3. Interpolated override targets start undefined (the game's clear lives in the PREVIOUS
     frame's workloads) and must be primed from the live target (`copyTextureRegion`;
     `RenderTarget::copyFromTarget` is cross-format-only and null-crashes on same-format).
  **Current state**: lib/rt64 reverted to the pre-`53000eb` patch set (verified: Original-mode
  readback clean, 30/s, 0 crash). **Framerate is LOCKED to Original** in recompui
  `ui_config_tab_graphics.cpp` (`[wcw fix]`, in lib-patches/RecompFrontend.patch): the UI
  control is disabled (grayed, with an explanatory description) AND `on_json_parse_option`
  coerces any saved `rr_option` back to Original â€” covers stale graphics.json AND its .bak
  (the backup-fallback loader bit us before with controls.json). Lock verified end to end: with
  `"rr_option": "Display"` planted in graphics.json, the game runs at Original rates (300
  presents/10s max vs 550-680 when Display was live). Diagnostics `WCW_FRAME_LOG=1` /
  `WCW_INTERP_LOG=1` were reverted with the rt64 changes (re-add from `53000eb` if needed).
- âœ… **A/V "FLICKERING" BOTH FIXED (2026-07-04).** Two independent root causes:
  1. **Audio crackle = constant SDL underruns** (~22/s: the device queue hit 0 on half the
     batches; gaps up to 79ms vs 46ms buffered). WCW registers NO AI event (verified:
     osSetEventMesg(OS_EVENT_AI) never called) â€” its audio thread generates one burst per
     ~33ms game frame sized by polling osAiGetLength, and ultramodern reports the whole host
     queue (hardware reports only the current DMA buffer), so the game kept ~0 headroom.
     **Fix**: `buffer_offset_frames = 6.0` in ultramodern `audio.cpp` (`[wcw fix]` â€” under-
     report by ~50ms so the game builds real depth; costs ~50ms latency) + SDL device chunk
     512 frames instead of 1024 in `main.cpp`. Verified: 0 underruns over 90s, 450-600-frame
     queue floor.
  2. **Video flicker = one PURE BLACK frame per game frame**, verified by a GPU swapchain
     readback (not screenshots â€” GDI capture of an MPO-promoted window returns bogus black
     frames; only trust the readback). Steady presented-luminance pattern [content, content,
     BLACK]. **Root cause: `src/main/main.cpp` passed `PresentationMode::PresentEarly`**
     (copied from BMHero) **to create_render_context.** PresentEarly fires a present whenever
     a workload writes a previously-displayed fb â€” correct for 1-gfx-task-per-frame games,
     but WCW builds each frame from MULTIPLE tasks and the LAST task of each frame PRE-CLEARS
     the next buffer (fbPair1), so RT64 presented the freshly-cleared buffer every frame.
     **Fix: PresentationMode::Console.** Verified: 0 black presents after boot, smooth
     luminance. Supporting fixes kept (all `[wcw fix]`): ultramodern `events.cpp` gfx thread
     now drains its action queue and drops stale ScreenUpdateActions (bounds scanout latency
     under backlog â€” upstream-relevant); RT64 present queue always locks `workloadMutex`
     before sampling the live target (present blit raced mid-render target states);
     plume `plume_d3d12.cpp` `copyTextureRegion` null-guard for buffer destinations (upstream
     bug â€” crashed on any textureâ†’buffer readback); RT64 enhancement default Console.
  - **Diagnostics added (env-gated, keep):** `WCW_PRESENT_LUM=1` = GPU readback of every
    presented frame â†’ `build-msvc/wcw_present_lum.csv` (n,ms,origin,addr,mean-luminance) +
    BMP dumps of presents 600-612 + timestamped CSV logs (submit/render/swap/vistate/pring/
    supd/dl) for full pipeline timeline reconstruction â€” this is how the flicker was found;
    `WCW_NO_INTERP=1` = disable RT64 interpolated-frame generation. `[audio]`/`[present]`
    stderr health lines are always on (1/s).
- ðŸ”§ Diagnostics left in for continued debugging: `src/main/main.cpp` (`std::set_terminate`
  backtrace, `SetUnhandledExceptionFilter` with AV address, and an opt-in all-thread stack
  sampler gated on env `WCW_SAMPLE=1`); plus throttled `[wcw]â€¦` logs in `lib/` (gitignored):
  `pi.cpp` rom-read bounds log, `events.cpp` VI null-guard + per-second tick, `mesgqueue.cpp`
  recv trace. The build links with `/MAP:WCWRecompiled.map`; resolve a Release frame RVA by the
  nearest "Publics by Value" symbol at/below it (preferred base `0x140000000`).
- ðŸ”§ **Diagnostics added this session** (keep until boot is stable): `src/main/main.cpp` has a
  `std::set_terminate` handler and `SetUnhandledExceptionFilter` that print a symbolized
  backtrace (dbghelp). To symbolize Release frames: build links with `/MAP:WCWRecompiled.map`
  (set via `CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS`); resolve a frame RVA by finding the nearest "Publics by
  Value" symbol at/below `RVA` (preferred base `0x140000000`). `lldb.exe` in VS LLVM is broken
  (missing `liblldb.dll`); cdb is not installed; WER LocalDumps need admin (HKLM).
- âŒ RSP microcode not yet recompiled (identified: embedded in main data â†’ IMEM `0x84001000`).
- âœ… Runtime libs cloned into `lib/` (N64ModernRuntime, RecompFrontend, rt64) â€” gitignored,
  but **all local `[wcw fix]` changes are checked in as `lib-patches/*.patch`** (manifest +
  `apply.ps1`/`export.ps1` there). After ANY edit under `lib/`, run `.\lib-patches\export.ps1`
  and commit; after a reclone, run `.\lib-patches\apply.ps1`.
- âœ… Port toolchain installed: **VS Build Tools 2022 (clang-cl 19.1.5, MSVC 14.44, CMake,
  Ninja, lld-link)**. Load it with `. .\tools\env-msvc.ps1`.
- âœ… **The full recompiled output (all 36 `funcs_*.c`) compiles cleanly with clang-cl
  against the real N64ModernRuntime `recomp.h`** â€” the generated code is buildable with the
  actual port toolchain, not just the harness.
- âŒ Not yet: libultra `ignored` integration, `src/main` wiring to `recomp::start`, RSP
  microcode, and the full RT64/runtime build + link. These are the remaining Phase-3 work.

### Stubs/patches applied to get a clean recompile (see `wcw.toml`)
These are first-pass shortcuts, each documented inline in `wcw.toml`, that need proper
handling before the game runs correctly:
- **9 `cache` instructions** (4 funcs) patched to `nop` â€” correct on host (kept func logic).
- ~~**15-func softfloat/int64 helper library** stubbed~~ â€” RESOLVED (2026-06-11): the integer
  group (ddiv/ddivu/dmultu) is un-stubbed real code; the FP<->int64 group is named to the IDO
  softfloat routines (librecomp `math_routines.cpp`, 4 shims added). No longer stubbed.
- **15 libultra OS/exception/TLB funcs** (`mfc0`/`mtc0`/`tlb*`/`eret`) stubbed â€” runtime
  should provide these (osSetIntMask, exception vectors, thread dispatch, â€¦).
- **2 handwritten-asm funcs** (`func_8001D2B4`, `func_80029B80`) stubbed â€” mis-split
  boundaries / RSP-IMEM branches in the OS layer.

### Execution proven (standalone harness, see `run/`)
We built a minimal harness (no RT64/runtime) that loads the ROM into a simulated 8 MB
RDRAM and actually executes the recompiled code. Result: it **runs faithfully**.
- Boot (`recomp_entrypoint`) runs cleanly: BSS-clear â†’ `game_main` â†’ libultra init,
  `osCreateThread`(game thread `func_800004AC`), `osStartThread`, return. No crashes.
- The game thread (`func_800004AC`), invoked directly, executes real game code at ~86 M
  recompiled-calls/sec and busy-waits in `func_80011BF0` (a PRNG) â€” i.e. it polls for a
  hardware/IPC condition the toy harness never signals.
- Conclusion: memory model, calling convention, control flow, and arithmetic all work.
  The only thing blocking further progress is the real runtime (hardware/threads/video),
  i.e. Phase 3. Nothing indicates a fault in the recompiled code itself.

## Roadmap (do these in order)

### Phase 1 â€” Disassemble the ROM to get symbols
There is no existing decomp, so we make our own symbol context. Standard tool:
[splat](https://github.com/ethteck/splat) (N64 binary splitter) which yields an ELF +
symbol map. Steps:
1. Set up a splat project under `disasm/` (yaml config pointing at the WCW ROM; detect
   compression, segments, code vs data).
2. Run splat to split the ROM and assemble an ELF with symbols.
3. Iterate until the ELF disassembles/links cleanly. This is the bulk of the early work.

Alternatively, author `syms/dump.toml` directly, but for a 12 MiB commercial game the
disassembly route is far more practical.

### Phase 2 â€” Build the recompiler and run it
1. Build N64Recomp: `cmake` + `cmake --build` in the sibling `N64Recomp` checkout
   (needs CMake â‰¥ 3.20, a C++20 compiler, submodules initialized recursively).
2. Copy `N64Recomp.exe` and `RSPRecomp.exe` to this project root.
3. Run `.\N64Recomp wcw.toml` â†’ populates `RecompiledFuncs/`.
4. Identify the audio (and any graphics) RSP microcode in the ROM; fill in `rsp/aspMain.toml`
   equivalents and run `.\RSPRecomp <ucode>.toml`.

### Phase 3 â€” Stand up the runtime + build  (IN PROGRESS)
1. âœ… Runtime libs cloned into `lib/` (N64ModernRuntime, RecompFrontend, rt64). Cloned as
   plain repos for now (gitignored); convert to proper submodules later. WCW has no decomp
   lib to add, unlike BMHero's `lib/bmhero`.
2. â³ Toolchain: needs **clang/clang-cl + MSVC + Windows SDK** (RT64 is D3D12/Vulkan, built
   with clang-cl â€” MinGW can't substitute). Install is a UAC-gated VS Build Tools install.
3. Flesh out `src/main/` (main.cpp wiring â†’ `recomp::start` with gfx/input/audio/rsp/thread
   callbacks; model on BMHero's ~800-line `src/main/main.cpp`). `GameEntry` needs
   `entrypoint_address = 0x80000400`, `entrypoint = recomp_entrypoint`, ROM hash.
4. Build with CMake (clang-cl/ninja); boot, debug.

**âš ï¸ The big Phase-3 prerequisite â€” libultra identification.** In a normal recomp
(BMHero/Zelda), libultra functions have *names* from the decomp, so the recompiler
`ignored`s them and **ultramodern** provides host-integrated implementations (threading,
DMA, VI retrace, message queues, controller I/O). WCW has **no symbol names** â€” every
function is `func_XXXX`, so the recompiler recompiled the game's *own* embedded libultra
(`func_80011560` = osCreateThread, `func_800116B0` = osStartThread, â€¦). Those don't
integrate with ultramodern's scheduler/timing â€” which is exactly why the `run/` experiment's
game thread busy-waits forever. So before the port can boot, we must **identify the
libultra boundary** (signature-match the game's `func_XXXX` against a known libultra
version), give them real names, and mark them `ignored` in `wcw.toml` so ultramodern takes
over the OS layer. This is analysis-only (no toolchain needed) and can proceed in parallel
with the toolchain install. It is the real bulk of Phase 3.

5. Recompile the RSP microcode (audio + graphics ucode) with `RSPRecomp` â€” required for
   the `get_rsp_microcode` callback and for any rendering/audio. (Ucode already located:
   embedded in main data, DMA'd to IMEM `0x84001000`.)

### Phase 4 â€” Patches & enhancements
Game-behavior fixes and PC enhancements live in `patches/` as MIPS-compiled C using
`RECOMP_PATCH` / `RECOMP_EXPORT` (see `patches/` + `patches.toml`). Widescreen, high-FPS
interpolation (RT64 matrix groups), input options, etc. â€” model on BMHero's `patches/`.

## Conventions

- C++ namespace for this game's glue code: `wcw` (BMHero uses `banjo`).
- Generated dirs (`RecompiledFuncs/`, `RecompiledPatches/`, build dirs) are gitignored.
- Never commit ROM data or extracted assets.
- Use PowerShell syntax for shell commands on this machine.
- When adapting from BMHero, replace: `BMHeroRecompiled`â†’`WCWRecompiled`,
  `banjo`/`bk`â†’`wcw`, `bmhero.z64`â†’the WCW ROM, `BMHeroSyms`â†’`syms`.

## Phase 1 progress / known ROM layout

splat is set up under `disasm/` (venv + `wcw.yaml`) and the fixed code segment splits
cleanly. Initial recon (see `disasm/README.md` for detail) established:

- **Compiler: IDO** (auto-detected) â€” the well-supported case for N64Recomp.
- **Total code â‰ˆ 800 KB / ~2,000 functions**, in two ROM regions only:
  - `0x001050`â€“`0x02A9B0` (~170 KB): fixed `main` segment â€” splits cleanly today.
  - `0xA20000`â€“`0xAC0000` (~640 KB): **overlay region**, all dynamically-loaded code,
    packed contiguously (not scattered).
  - The ~10 MB in between is assets (no code).
- **Overlay system SOLVED** (see `disasm/README.md` for the full map): exactly **two CPU
  overlays** that swap at VRAM `0x80090000`, described by 9-word descriptors at
  `0x80032BA0` / `0x80032BC4`, loaded by `0x8000075C` and entered via `0x800007C8`.
  Both now disassemble cleanly in `wcw.yaml`. They load at a **fixed address** (no
  per-load relocation), which keeps the recomp simpler.
  - Overlay A: ROM `0xA21750`â€“`0xA69570`; Overlay B: ROM `0xA69570`â€“`0xAC2970`.
- **RSP microcode** is embedded in the main data section (~`0x8002AC10`) and DMA'd to IMEM
  `0x84001000`. RSPRecomp's job, not a CPU overlay.

## Open questions to resolve early
- Precise RSP microcode bounds (audio) and the graphics ucode variant (F3DEX family).
- Data/rodata/jump-table boundary refinement within each segment (normal splat iteration).
- ~~Overlay table / layout?~~ Solved â€” two fixed-address swapping overlays at `0x80090000`.
- ~~Are overlays relocatable?~~ No â€” fixed load address.
- ~~Is the code compressed?~~ No standard compression; the code regions are plain MIPS.
- ~~Which compiler?~~ IDO.
